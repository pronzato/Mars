Use CoPilot Studio to design a Fabric CoPilot Agent trained on:

Fabric Chronicle traces (to learn real trading flows)

Fabric Schema & Discovery metadata (to understand APIs and entitlements)

3Forge layout templates (to generate UI scaffolds)
The Agent would then auto-generate Fabric-ready code, configs, and 3Forge panels, register them in discovery, and validate via Chronicle replays.



We can use CoPilot Studio to build an AI Agent integrated with Fabric that tackles two major opportunities:

UI Replacement & Modernization

The Agent learns existing trading workflows from Fabric Chronicle recordings of live AMPS API flows.

From those traces and screenshots of the legacy UI, it auto-generates Fabric-compliant services and 3Forge dashboards, replacing unsupported apps quickly and safely.

This delivers a maintainable, fully governed UI stack with minimal manual coding.

Unified Data & Intelligent Access

Once the Agent is integrated with Fabric’s schema, entitlement, and discovery APIs, it gains access to a unified view of enterprise data (trading, reference, analytics, etc.).

That lets users and developers query, build, and automate new data views or services directly through the Agent — accelerating discovery, analysis, and support workflows.
