When gRPC clients connect from outside OpenShift to services running inside the cluster, Kerberos authentication is handled using the standard HTTP/ service principal (SPN), such as HTTP/service.apps.cluster.example.com@REALM. This is because OpenShift routes and ingress controllers terminate HTTPS at the edge and perform authentication at the HTTP layer before forwarding traffic to the target gRPC service. The client obtains a Kerberos service ticket for this SPN from the enterprise KDC and presents it during the TLS handshake. The ingress verifies the ticket using the service’s keytab mounted in the pod or gateway, establishing a trusted identity before passing the gRPC request through over HTTP/2. This allows external clients to use Kerberos-based single sign-on seamlessly, while the OpenShift environment maintains secure, service-level authentication.
