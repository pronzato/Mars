h1. Fabric Tapestry – TL;DR Selling Points

h2. Why Tapestry Exists
Fabric Tapestry provides an ultra-fast path from *data → dashboards* using a declarative, dataset-driven UI engine with dual execution backends:
* *LOCAL_DATASET* for rapid developer workflows

h2. What Makes Tapestry Unique
* *Dual Backend Architecture:* Switch between LOCAL and SERVICE mode with a single system property.
* *Live-Streaming Tables:* Real-time grids via Flight SQL.
* *Entitlements-Native:* PDP-based row removal and column masking automatically applied.
* *Zero-Boilerplate UI:* Sorting, filtering, pagination, toolbars, actions, row selection — all generated from metadata.
* *Developer Acceleration:* DIRECT dataset querying (DuckDB/Parquet) for instant visibility into new datasets.
* *Production Alignment:* The SAME UI runs on curated enterprise services without modification.
* *Autogenerated Dashboards:* Tapestry can generate HTML skeleton pages from dataset metadata.

h2. Who Benefits
* *Quants:* See datasets instantly while building them.
* *Developers:* Prototype dashboards in minutes, not days.
