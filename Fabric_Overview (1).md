# Fabric: A Unified Foundation for Scalable Data and Services

## What is Fabric
Fabric is a unified **data and services SDK** — not just a framework — designed to provide a consistent way to publish, discover, and interact with enterprise data such as reference data, positions, entitlements, and order state.  
It offers a single, standards-based abstraction across messaging, APIs, and storage — making it easier to build client applications and scalable, resilient services.

Fabric runs **anywhere** — on **Windows**, **Linux**, or in containers — with the same code used in production also runnable on a developer’s laptop.  
It can be used as an **API** for applications or as a **CLI** for interactive workflows.  
When launched inside an **IDE**, Fabric connects with **Copilot** to streamline development and enable rich **data exploration**, giving developers rapid feedback loops and powerful local-to-prod parity.

## Why Fabric Matters
- **Consistency and Reuse:** Common APIs, schemas, and patterns reduce duplication across desks, teams, and systems.  
- **Open Standards:** Built on vendor-neutral technologies like gRPC, Arrow Flight, Parquet, Iceberg, and S3 — ensuring interoperability and long-term flexibility.  
- **Scalability:** Natively supports containerized deployment models (OpenShift, Kubernetes) with autoscaling, blue/green releases, and integrated observability.  
- **Performance:** Zero-copy, columnar data exchange for high-throughput analytics and low-latency transactional workloads.  
- **Incremental Adoption:** Enables current systems to adopt Fabric incrementally — integrating existing data sources, APIs, and entitlements without full rewrites.  
- **Observability & Governance:** Integrated telemetry (OTel), schema registry, and audit capabilities ensure transparency, control, and compliance across environments.  

## Use Cases
- **Reference Data:** A single, governed source accessible by all regions and systems.  
- **Positions & Order State:** Real-time event propagation with guaranteed consistency.  
- **Entitlements:** Centralized enforcement with row-level filtering and auditability.  
- **Analytics & Research:** Unified access to historical and real-time data using Arrow-based pipelines and DuckDB/Parquet queries on S3.

## Summary
Fabric is a **developer-first SDK** — not a monolithic framework — designed to unify how data and services interact across enterprise systems.  
It bridges existing architectures with open standards and cloud-native practices, enabling teams to deliver faster, safer, and more scalable applications, whether through APIs, CLIs, or integrated IDE workflows.
