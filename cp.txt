Agent Opportunity:
Develop a “Fabric CoPilot Agent” that connects CoPilot Studio to Fabric’s unified data layer.

This agent could:
Expose Fabric schemas, endpoints, and metadata as prompts for CoPilot Studio.
Enable AI-assisted creation of new Fabric-compliant services, components, and dashboards.
Provide a foundation for future automation — e.g., self-documenting APIs, test generation, and pipeline creation for quants and developers.

What the CoPilot Agent does with Fabric

Uses Fabric as its system of record and action surface. The Agent reads Fabric’s schemas, endpoints, and metadata (discovery topics, component/endpoint models, entitlements) and then acts through Fabric to generate code, wire services, and configure UIs.

Learns real flows via Fabric Chronicle. Chronicle captures AMPS message patterns (orders, acks, rejects, cancels, RFQs). The Agent ingests these traces to infer request/response shapes, SLAs, retry rules, error semantics, and back-pressure patterns.

Generates Fabric-compliant services/UI. The Agent emits boilerplate APIs, DTOs, and 3Forge panel definitions that match Fabric’s schema/entitlement model—so everything is immediately consistent with the platform.

Keeps governance automatic. The Agent calls Fabric’s policy/entitlements layer to scaffold default row-/field-level rules per group, logs changes to discovery/metadata topics, and produces auditable diffs/messages for review.

Orchestrates modernization tasks. It can propose a plan, open PRs, update service manifests, produce test fixtures from Chronicle samples, and publish “how-to” docs into Fabric metadata for support and traders.

Agent Capabilities (concrete “skills”)

Discover & Model

Read Fabric schemas/endpoints; map Chronicle traffic → canonical models.

Detect field drifts and propose schema migrations + compat notes.

Code & Configure

Generate AMPS client stubs, validation, retries, idempotency keys.

Create Fabric service scaffolds (gRPC/Flight/HTTP) with builders, config, and test harnesses.

Emit 3Forge UI layouts/panels (tables, ladders, blotters, depth, alerts) bound to Fabric endpoints.

Wire & Secure

Create default group-scoped policies (deny-by-default outside group).

Register endpoints/components in Fabric discovery with health/OTel hooks (toggleable).

Test & Validate

Build golden message sets from Chronicle; auto-generate unit/integration tests.

Spin up a “shadow” run using recorded flows to validate new UI/API paths.

Document & Coach

Produce living README/playbooks + “diff explainers” per change.

Generate 3Forge operator dashboards for runtime checks.

Why this is a strong CoPilot Studio pilot

High leverage: Agent operates where Fabric already centralizes truth (schemas, endpoints, policies), so output is usable immediately.

Repeatable pattern: Once proven for the trading UI, the same Agent can modernize adjacent workflows (RFQ, quotes, allocations, surveillance).

Risk-controlled: Chronicle-driven “shadow” validation + group-scoped default policies reduce migration risk without slowing delivery.

Example “Agent loop” (Observe → Plan → Act)

Observe: “Ingest last 7 days of Chronicle for /orders and /allocations; summarize API verbs, payloads, errors.”

Plan: “Propose service/API + 3Forge layout that preserves current workflows and adds missing cancel/replace shortcuts.”

Act: “Generate Fabric service + AMPS client + 3Forge panels; register endpoints; scaffold default policies for group ‘trading-x’; open PR.”

Sample prompts you’d use with the Agent

“Learn the /trading/new-order and /trading/cancel flows from Chronicle; produce schemas and validate against Fabric’s existing Order schema. Flag mismatches and propose a migration plan.”

“Generate a 3Forge blotter + ladder wired to Fabric endpoints for quotes/orders; add hotkeys matching the attached screenshots.”

“Create a Fabric service ‘trade-entry’ with AMPS in/out, default group policy, health checks, and tests replaying Chronicle samples for orders, rejects, and cancels.”

“Publish an operator dashboard (3Forge) for message lag, NACKs, and downstream acks using Fabric discovery metadata.”

Guardrails & compliance (built-in)

Entitlements-first: The Agent must call Fabric’s policy APIs to create/modify rules; changes are auditable and review-gated.

Data minimization: Chronicle sampling is scoped to message types and groups; PII fields are masked/redacted per Fabric schema tags.

Human-in-the-loop: All code/policy/UI changes are PR’d with diffs, test evidence, and rollback notes.

Success metrics (for the pilot)

Time to first working UI (from screenshots to live 3Forge)

Lines of boilerplate eliminated (Agent-generated vs hand-written)

Defect rate in shadow validation (Chronicle replays)

MTTR for policy/endpoint changes (via Agent vs manual)



ONE PAGER

I’d like to propose a CoPilot Studio pilot that showcases how an AI Agent integrated with Fabric can accelerate modernization and reduce tech debt:

Use CoPilot Studio + Fabric Chronicle to record live AMPS trading API flows so CoPilot can learn the trading workflows automatically.

Agent generates Fabric-compliant services and 3Forge UI panels from those recordings and screenshots of the legacy app — producing a working, supported replacement in a fraction of the time.

Fabric integration provides unified schemas, entitlements, and metadata, so everything the Agent creates is automatically governed and discoverable.

Result: Faster migration, less boilerplate, consistent governance, and a reusable pattern for future Fabric-based services and dashboards.
