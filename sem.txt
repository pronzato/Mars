Semantic components in Fabric

Curated datasets — named, governed datasets that define what the data represents

Governed materialized views — derived datasets published and reused as first-class assets

Schemas — fixed field names and types that define the data contract

Metadata — stored context describing dataset meaning, origin, and production

Entitlements — row- and column-level access rules enforced at query time
