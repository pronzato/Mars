Fabric runs consistently across Windows, Linux, and containerized environments, ensuring the same code that powers production can be executed directly in a developerâ€™s workspace.
It operates both as an API for integrated applications and as a CLI for interactive workflows.
When used within an IDE, Fabric integrates with Copilot to accelerate development and enable deep data exploration, giving developers rapid feedback and full parity between local and production environments.
