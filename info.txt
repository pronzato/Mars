Fabric API
A Scalable Foundation for Core Data and Services
Purpose

Fabric provides a unified API and data exchange layer for the firm’s foundational services —
including Reference Data, Positions, Entitlements, and Order State.
It ensures consistent access, interoperability, and observability across regions and platforms.

Core Principles

Open & Vendor-Neutral – Built on gRPC, Arrow Flight, Parquet, Iceberg, S3, and OpenTelemetry.

Unified Access – One API model for real-time, streaming, and analytical workloads.

Interoperable – Works seamlessly across existing environments and OpenShift.

Observable & Secure – Full tracing, metrics, and TLS/Kerberos integration.

Scalable Deployment – Autoscaling, canary, and blue/green releases built-in.

The Fabric Architecture
Plane	Technology	Purpose
Control Plane	gRPC	Contract-based APIs for control, configuration, and service operations.
Event Plane	AMPS Topics	Real-time metadata, availability, and application-level events.
Data Plane	Arrow Flight / Parquet / Iceberg	High-throughput, columnar data transport and storage on S3.

(OpenTelemetry provides unified tracing and metrics across all planes.)

Value

Scalable Core Services – Consistent data model for global reference, position, entitlement, and order state.

Faster Integration – Reusable schemas and contracts shorten delivery cycles.

Operational Insight – Built-in observability for every API and data flow.

Platform Flexibility – Deploys on bare metal, VMs, or OpenShift with the same interfaces.

Future-Ready – Aligns with open-source and industry standards for long-term resilience.

In One Line

Fabric enables scalable, observable, standards-based data and service integration — connecting today’s platforms with tomorrow’s architecture.
