# Fabric: A Unified Foundation for Scalable Data and Services

## What is Fabric
Fabric is a unified data and services framework that provides a consistent way to publish, discover, and interact with enterprise data — from reference data and positions to entitlements and order state.  
It delivers a single, standards-based abstraction across messaging, APIs, and storage — making it easier to build client applications and scalable, resilient services that can run anywhere.

## Why Fabric Matters
- **Consistency and Reuse:** Common APIs, schemas, and patterns reduce duplication across desks, teams, and systems.  
- **Open Standards:** Built on vendor-neutral technologies like gRPC, Arrow Flight, Parquet, Iceberg, and S3 — ensuring interoperability and investment protection.  
- **Scalability:** Natively supports containerized deployment models (OpenShift, Kubernetes) with autoscaling, blue/green releases, and observability built-in.  
- **Performance:** Zero-copy, columnar data exchange for high-throughput analytics and low-latency transactional workloads.  
- **Migration Path:** Enables current systems to adopt Fabric incrementally — integrating existing data sources, APIs, and entitlements without re-engineering.  
- **Observability & Governance:** Integrated telemetry, schema registry, and audit capabilities ensure transparency, control, and compliance across environments.  

## Use Cases
- **Reference Data:** A single, governed source accessible by all regions and systems.  
- **Positions & Order State:** Real-time event propagation with guaranteed consistency.  
- **Entitlements:** Centralized enforcement with row-level filtering and auditability.  
- **Analytics & Research:** Unified access to historical and real-time data using Arrow-based pipelines and DuckDB/Parquet queries on S3.

## Summary
Fabric establishes the foundation for the next generation of data and service platforms — consistent, observable, and interoperable.  
It bridges existing systems with open standards and cloud-native practices, enabling teams to deliver faster, safer, and more scalable client and data services.
